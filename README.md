### Reflection

This project was not too hard. I enjoyed working on building something out without having to worry about my own design decisions (I am absolutely not a designer) and when everything was the same as the provided image it was very exciting! I also spent a bit reading the descriptions of each of the different transition types to figure out how to make the transition only apply to hover and not the rest of the css when I couldn't find the answer on the internet.
